### Create trusted network for MFA in Office365

## What in MFA?

MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, a security mechanism that requires users to verify their identity using two or more independent factors. These factors are typically grouped into three categories:


## How MFA Works
When logging into a system protected by MFA:
  -  You enter your username and password (first factor: something you know).
  -  You verify your identity using an additional factor, such as:

## Benefits of MFA
   -  **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised.
   -  **Compliance**: Many industries require MFA for regulatory compliance (e.g., healthcare, finance).
   -  **Flexibility**: MFA integrates with cloud services, VPNs, and enterprise systems.
   -  **Prevents Common Attacks**: Protects against phishing, credential theft, and brute-force attacks.
