# Configure BitLocker on Windows Devices with Intune

### What is BitLocker?
  BitLocker, a feature offered by Windows, helps encrypt volumes, aiding your organization in avoiding data theft and loss from malicious attempts. Itâ€™s a feature that enables encryption at res

### Why do we need to enable Bitlocker?


### Requirements to enable BitLocker with Intune:
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager Intune License
- Entra Joined or Hybrid Entra Joined device.
- Devices must have a TPM chip at version 1.2 or higher (2.0 recommended)
- Windows 10/11 Pro, Education & Enterprise
- BIOS set to Native EUFI
  
### Create an Endpoint Security Policy to Configure BitLocker in Intune.
  -  Enable Bitlocker using Intune
  -  Create configuration profile for Bitlocker in Intune
  -  Configure Bitlocker Policy using Intune
  -  Monitor Bitlocker Encryption Status
  -  
 ##### Create BitLocker Policy in Intune
   -  login Microsoft Intune admin center https://intune.microsoft.com
   -  Navigate to Endpoint Security node and under Manage, select Disk Encryption.To create a new policy, select Create Policy.

       -  Platform: `Windows 10 and later`
       -  Profile: `BitLocker`
       -  Name: `Enable and Configure Bitlocker using Intune`
       -  Description: `Create an endpoint security policy for BitLocker`

##### Configure Settings in Intune
####### Bitlocker
  -    - Require Device Encryption " ``Enabled` Allows the administrator to require encryption to be enabled using BitLocker device encryption
       - Allow Warning For Other Disk Encryption: `Disabled` notification for encryption and warning prompt for encryption of other disks) and silently enable encryption on user machines.
       - Configure Recovery Password Rotation:`Refresh on for Azure AD-joined devices` Recovery password rotation when using the operating system and fixed drives on devices connected to the AAD and Hybrid domains

####### Operating system drive
       - Enforce drive encryption type on operating system drives : `Enabled`
           - Select the encryption type: (Device) `Full encryption`
           - Configure TPM startup key and PIN: `Allow startup key and PIN with TPM`
           - Configure TPM startup key: `Allow TPM`
           - Configure TPM startup PIN:`Allow startup PIN with TPM`
           - Configure TPM startup:`Allow startup PIN with TPM`

###### The next step is to create a Tag: I leave it as default

###### Assignments

The next step is to assign a group of machines on which to apply encryption. In my case, I've chosen all devices. 
You can add exclusions in the "Excluded Groups" section below.

###### Review + Create
The last step is to validate and create the encryption rule:
