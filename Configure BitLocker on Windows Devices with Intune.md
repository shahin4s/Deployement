   -  Require Device Encryption " ``Enabled` Allows the administrator to require encryption to be enabled using BitLocker device encryption
       -  Allow Warning For Other Disk Encryption: `Disabled` notification for encryption and warning prompt for encryption of other disks) and silently enable encryption on user machines.
       -  Configure Recovery Password Rotation:`Refresh on for Azure AD-joined devices` Recovery password rotation when using the operating system and fixed drives on devices connected to the AAD and Hybrid domains

###### Fixed Data Drive

##### The next step is to create a Tag: I leave it as default

##### Assignments

The next step is to assign a group of machines on which to apply encryption. In my case, I've chosen all devices. 
You can add exclusions in the "Excluded Groups" section below.
